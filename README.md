# HTML Fullscreen Example

This repository contains two HTML files (`index.html` and `app.html`) that automatically request fullscreen when opened in a browser.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `index.html` or `app.html` in your browser.
3. The page will attempt to enter fullscreen mode automatically.

> **Note:** Some browsers may block automatic fullscreen without a user gesture (click/tap).
